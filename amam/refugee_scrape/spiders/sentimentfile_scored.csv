Except the writer forgets one major point in the rise of Hungarian PM and Mr Trump (which the writer so laments....).   It's the left that is responsible for their rise.  They have made such a mess of everything ruined everything they touch act like they hate their very own countries that the people that love their countries are hungry for better times and love of country.   If the left weren't such failures and didn't constantly tell people how bad their own countries are (that the left made by the way) the rise of Hungarian PM and Mr Trump wouldn't be that much of an issue!
